# THE SLUMS – Los Barrios Ocultos

**A Spanish language learning text adventure built in Python.**

THE SLUMS – Los Barrios Ocultos is an evolving interactive project designed to explore Spanish through worldbuilding, exploration, and dialogue. The goal is to learn the language naturally by moving through an atmospheric environment filled with rooms, characters, and small everyday interactions. It begins as a single-player text adventure but is structured so new systems and mechanics can be added as programming skills grow.

This project is both a language-learning tool and a creative space for practicing Python fundamentals. Each new concept—objects, data storage, commands, menus, or file handling—becomes another opportunity to expand the world. Development happens gradually and intentionally, focusing on clean organization, modular design, and steady improvement rather than rushing toward a final product.

## Project Goals

- Create a simple, immersive world where players encounter Spanish vocabulary in context.
- Build a foundation of reusable systems: rooms, items, commands, and NPC interactions.
- Practice Python in a meaningful, long-term project instead of isolated exercises.
- Keep development transparent, consistent, and enjoyable.

---

## Current Features

- Project structure with dedicated folders for code, data, and tools.
- A basic `main.py` entry point for starting the game.
- A time-tracking script (`time_keep.py`) that logs development sessions using JSON.
- Beginnings of a modular layout for future world or room systems.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **JSON** for data storage and time logs
- **Git + GitHub** for version control and multi-device development
